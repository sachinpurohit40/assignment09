    "\n",
    "Advantages of Lambda Functions:\n",
    "\n",
    "Conciseness: Lambda functions are very concise and can often be defined in a single line of code. This makes them handy for simple, one-off operations.\n",
    "\n",
    "Readability: Lambda functions can make the code more readable when used appropriately, especially for small, single-purpose functions. They can help avoid cluttering the code with unnecessary function definitions.\n",
    "\n",
    "No need for a separate name: Lambda functions do not require a separate name like regular functions. This can be advantageous when you need a small function for a short-lived purpose, and you don't want to clutter your namespace with function names.\n",
    "\n",
    "Functional Programming: Lambda functions are commonly used in functional programming paradigms. They can be used as arguments to higher-order functions like map, filter, and reduce.\n",
    "\n",
    "Limitations of Lambda Functions:\n",
    "\n",
    "Limited Complexity: Lambda functions are limited in terms of complexity. They are meant for simple operations and cannot contain multiple statements, assignments, or complex logic. If you need to write a more complex function, you should use a regular function.\n",
    "\n",
    "Limited Documentation: Lambda functions do not support docstrings, making it harder to provide documentation for the function's purpose and usage. In contrast, regular functions can include docstrings for better documentation.\n",
    "\n",
    "Lack of Reusability: Lambda functions are not reusable. If you need to use the same function in multiple places within your code, it's more practical to define a regular function that can be called multiple times.\n",
    "\n",
    "Limited Debugging: Debugging lambda functions can be more challenging compared to regular functions. Regular functions have named identifiers, making it easier to pinpoint issues during debugging. Lambda functions, being anonymous, can make it harder to identify problems.\n",
    "\n",
    "Scope of Variables: Lambda functions have access to variables in their enclosing scope (lexical scoping), but this can sometimes lead to unexpected behavior, especially if the variables change outside the lambda's scope."
